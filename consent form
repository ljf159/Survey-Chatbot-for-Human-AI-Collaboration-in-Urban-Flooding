This survey is part of a research study conducted by Dr. Jinfeng Lou at Carnegie Mellon University and is funded by Carnegie Bosch Institute.

Summary  
This study examines how professionals in urban flooding management interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools and how human-AI collaboration can improve flood response and mitigation efforts. The study is designed to gather insights from professionals in transportation, emergency response, urban planning, AI development, and other related fields.

Purpose 
The purpose of this research is to explore how human-AI collaboration can enhance decision-making, preparedness, and response to urban flooding. Understanding these interactions will help improve AI technologies and policies that support flood management.

Procedures  
Participation in this study involves completing a 10-minute online survey facilitated by an AI-powered chatbot. The survey consists of multiple-choice and open-ended questions about your experience, perspectives on AI tools, and opinions on human-AI collaboration in flood management. 

Participant Requirements  
•	Participation is limited to individuals 18 years or older.
•	Participants must be professionals involved in urban flooding-related fields, such as transportation departments, AI technology providers, urban planners, emergency services, sewer and drainage workers, frontline operators, meteorologists, or other relevant stakeholders.
